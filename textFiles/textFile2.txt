You see a magician coming forth, he wants to speak with you.
After talking to him, you find out there is a eunicorn in the forest, which he hates.
He offers you 100 quids to take it down, because his magic is not strong enough.
He says he will also show you the way out of the forest.
It is up to you, whether you want to kill the animal. 
Only a shot in the head /left-click/ will defeat it. 
After closing this window, press with your mouse on the game screen to continue playing and go on walking.
